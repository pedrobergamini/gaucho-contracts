# Gaucho Finance ðŸšœ ðŸšœ

### Gaucho finance is a sample DeFi project under development that automates yield farming on SushiSwap. It's still an experimental under development software and not production ready.

### Why Gaucho?
Many DeFi projects use farming references, so I decided to name this set of contracts referencing the population of a Brazilian state, known to have a lot of farmers.

### Architecture

![alt text](https://github.com/pedrobergamini/gaucho-contracts/blob/master/gaucho-architecture.png?raw=true)

Gaucho Finance implements two non-upgradeable smart contracts, which applies the Factory design pattern. With this pattern, the contract owner can create multiple Vaults linking to a SushiSwap liquidity pool. Gaucho Vaults are ERC20 compliant, so users can easily convert back and forth their liquidity pool assets. Gaucho Finance is implementing a way to automatically reinvest Sushi tokens for gas savings and other cool features.
